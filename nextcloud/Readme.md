This directory contains the terraform and heat scripts for running Nextcloud.

Nextcloud is a free and open source suite of client-server software which 
manages the creation and hosting of files. It is becoming a popular alternative
to similar software such as Dropbox and Google Drive.

To run terraform and create a Nextcloud instance **with an existing volume:**

**In the terminal**

```shell
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --var domain_name="<your-domain-name>" --var host_name="<your-host-name>" --var ddns_password="<your-ddns-password>" --var file_upload_size="<size in mega-bytes>m" --var keyname="<your-key-name>" --var volume_uuid="<volume id>"
```

To run terraform and create a Nextcloud instance **without an existing volume:**

**In the terminal**

```shell
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --var domain_name="<your-domain-name>" --var host_name="<your-host-name>" --var ddns_password="<your-ddns-password>" --var file_upload_size="<size in mega-bytes>m" --var keyname="<your-key-name>"
```

Note:
a) If you choose to use an existing volume, replace volume id with the id of your previously created volume for the
Nextcloud database. 

b) Only change the `file_upload_size` if you require more than the default (1024MB).

c) Floating IP should be generated and printed after this step, it is
recommended you take note of this as you may need it later.
